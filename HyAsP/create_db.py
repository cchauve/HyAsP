# Implements command 'create' of HyAsP.
#
# Takes a list of plasmids with annotated genes and extracts all genes into a FASTA file.
# The plasmids can be provided as GenBank files or as accession numbers (in this case,
# the GenBank files are temporarily downloaded).
#
# In addition, a plasmid table obtained from NCBI can be used as the source.
# Such a table can be downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/plasmids/
# and all possible columns should be selected.
# Additional filtering options are available for this source:
#  - choose only plasmids released before a particular date
#  - blacklisting of plasmids not to be included in the database
#  - choosing the type of sequence database (RefSeq, GenBank)
#
# There are further options allowing to dereplicate the genes (based on their sequence),
# to consider only plasmids in a certain length range, and to collect the plasmid sequences in a FASTA file.
#
# Requirements:
# standard UNIX tools (curl, rm)
